## Objective
The aim of the game is to get rid of all the cards.
Each player receives 14 cards. On their turn, the player can play an allowed combination of cards or pass the turn. It is not mandatory to play even if you can.

## Valid Combinations
There are several possible combinations:

- **Set**: from one to four cards all of the **same value**, but of different suits;
- **Straight**: three or more cards of consecutive values (not necessarily all of the same suit);
- **Double straight**: three or more consecutive pairs of values.
